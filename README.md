# Wireless-Patient-Monitor---Heart-Rate-Monitoring-Application
Description
This project aims to develop a heart-rate monitoring application using a wearable, wireless patient monitor design and the Bluetooth 5 BLE evaluation module. The patient monitor is designed to be comfortable for the patient to wear and communicate wirelessly with the monitoring application via Bluetooth. The Proteus software was used to simulate the hardware design and the development of the Bluetooth communication protocol.

Prerequisites
Proteus software
Bluetooth 5 BLE evaluation module
Basic knowledge of Bluetooth communication protocols
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine
Open the Proteus software and import the provided .hex file for the hardware design simulation
Connect the Bluetooth 5 BLE evaluation module to your computer
Run the simulation to test the hardware design and Bluetooth communication
Usage
Upload the firmware to the microcontroller in the patient monitor design
Ensure that the patient monitor is connected to the Bluetooth 5 BLE evaluation module
Open the monitoring application on your smartphone or tablet
Real-time heart rate data will be displayed on the screen
If the heart rate falls outside a predetermined range, an alert will be triggered
