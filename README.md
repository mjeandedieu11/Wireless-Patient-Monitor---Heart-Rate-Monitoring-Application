# Wireless-Patient-Monitor---Heart-Rate-Monitoring-Application
Description
This project aims to develop a heart-rate monitoring application using a wearable, wireless patient monitor design and the Bluetooth 5 BLE evaluation module. The patient monitor is designed to be comfortable for the patient to wear and communicate wirelessly with the monitoring application via Bluetooth. The application displays real-time heart rate data and can trigger alerts if the heart rate falls outside a predetermined range.

Prerequisites
Bluetooth 5 BLE evaluation module
